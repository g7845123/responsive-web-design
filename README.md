This is a project for [Responsive Web Design Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud893) Course provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). 

In this project, I was provided with an [unresponsive web site](https://www.udacity.com/api/nodes/3577278729/supplemental_media/rwdf-l2-startzip/download) which can only work appropriately for screen wider than 800px. Based on the starter code, I should build a responsive website that works well on any device.

Click [this link](http://g7845123.github.io/responsive-web-design) for a online demo of this application. 

All Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories etc. that I referred to or used are listed in "references.md".
